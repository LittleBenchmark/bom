# Little Benchmark Bill of Materials App
This BOM app should be handy for Open Hardware hackers and makers. The goal is to provide a free and open source application that makes it easy and efficient to share bill of materials for your project. These can then be shared via Tindie (http://www.tindie.com), Dangerous Prototype Store (http://dangerousprototypes.com/store/), OshPark (https://oshpark.com/), etc.

# More Goals

- Retrieve part details based on a URL that's input automatically so that you don't have to enter part data.
